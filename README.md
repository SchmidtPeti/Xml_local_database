# Xml_local_database
This class was made for a particularunity game but I can show perfectly how does the xml store works in c#.

## Usage

The more_nodes() method do the main part of the job because it allows to save more than one data in the xml file.
The example from my personal project can show very well(delete, edit and add method)
