# Xml_local_database
This class was made for a particular unity game but It can show perfectly how does the xml store works in c#.

## Usage

The more_nodes() method do main part of the the job because it allows to save more than one data in one xml file.
The example from my personal project can show very well(delete, edit and add method)
